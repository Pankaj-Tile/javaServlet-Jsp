Java Servlet: Request Dispatch and Attributes
This Java servlet example demonstrates request dispatch and attribute handling. We’ll create a simple login system using Java technology, with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the integrated development environment (IDE) and Apache Tomcat 9.0.x as the server.

Project Overview
IDE: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Language: Java
Technology: Servlet
Server: Apache Tomcat 9.0.x
RequestDispatcher Interface
The RequestDispatcher interface allows us to forward requests and manage attributes. We’ll cover both forwarding to another resource and including content from another resource.

Example Scenario
Let’s assume we have the following files:

home.html: A form for user input,where dispacher request is use on button,also set as a home page of website.
index.html:form for getting input form user.
register.java: A servlet class for processing the response.
success.java: A servlet class for displaying a success message.
web.xml: The deployment descriptor file containing servlet information.

also hear submit.war : can directly deploy the functionlities on web server like apache tomacat
